Let is used when assigning a variable  or naming a variable while const is used when you want to store or 
declare a permanent or constant name. 
Var is used to declare a temporary variable so its no different from let but with constant its not easily
changed.

we can use a variable after we've defined by assiging it to a value.

we declare a string by putting a value in a double quote "".

we can create a string using a double quotes because 
thats the standard for a string while the single
quote is for characters(char)

9 with quotes makes it a string while 9 without a quote is recognised
as a number.

Declaration introduces a new identifier to a program.
Redeclaration re introduces an old identifier to a program
Reassignment it used to set an already existing  variable name to a value
Assignment it is used to set a value to a variable name.
